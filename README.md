## Project #5: Vehicle Detection

The goals of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a Linear SVM classifier
* Append binned spatial features, as well as histograms of color, to a HOG feature vector
* Normalize features and randomize a selection for training and testing
* Implement a sliding-window search and use a trained classifier to search for vehicles in images
* Create a heat map of recurring detections frame-by-frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles in a video stream
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected
